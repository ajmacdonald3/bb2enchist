Description: This package transforms resighting data in the format submitted to
    BandedBirds.org into encounter histories. Package functions allow dataframes
    formatted as per BandedBirds.org to be returned as a dataframe of encounter
    histories for each flagged Red Knot encountered. A variety of resighting
    period intervals can be accommodated (i.e. day, month, year, custom).
    Dataframes that can be exported as CSV files for further analysis in R and
    dataframes that can be exported as INP files for analysis in Program MARK
    are generated.
